# Sales-Analysis-and-Profit-Trends-
Project Overview

This project aims to perform sales analysis for an e-commerce business, focusing on identifying key trends, customer behavior, and profit optimization using data analytics techniques. By analyzing historical sales data from platforms like Amazon, this project uncovers critical insights such as seasonal trends, customer segmentation, and product performance.

We utilize Python for data collection and processing, Snowflake for data warehousing, and Power BI for creating interactive data visualizations. The ultimate goal is to provide business stakeholders with actionable insights that enable data-driven decision-making, boosting overall profitability and operational efficiency.

Key Features

Data Collection:

Web scraping using Python's BeautifulSoup library to gather real-time product data from Amazon.
Hypothetical datasets for customer behavior, order history, and returns are used to simulate real-world scenarios.

Data Warehousing:

A Snowflake schema is used to store the data, with relationships between key entities such as customers, products, orders, suppliers, and returns.
Tables include:

Products: Product names, prices, and reviews.
Customers: Demographic information, purchase history.
Orders: Order details, including items purchased, quantities, and dates.
Returns: Reasons for product returns and customer satisfaction.

Data Visualization:

Power BI is employed to create an intuitive, interactive dashboard for data analysis.

Visualizations include:

Sales trends over time (line charts).
Product performance by category (bar and funnel charts).
Return reasons (pie charts).
Geographic distribution of orders (maps).
Customer satisfaction and reviews (gauge and tree charts).

Data Insights:

Key insights extracted from the data include:
Identifying customer segments based on demographics and purchase behavior.
Pinpointing top-selling and low-performing products.
Determining seasonal spikes in sales.
Analyzing product return rates and reasons.
Estimating overall customer satisfaction and sentiment through product reviews.
